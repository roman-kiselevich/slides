            #### What has changed
              Redirect of trailing slashes

              `/api/v1/entity/ - 308 Permanent Redirect -> /api/v1/entity`
              ```java [1]
              @Deprecated(since = "6.0")
              public PathMatchConfigurer setUseTrailingSlashMatch(Boolean trailingSlashMatch) {
                  this.trailingSlashMatch = trailingSlashMatch;
                  return this;
              }
              ```
            ---
            #### What has changed
              Spring Doc 1.8 -> 2.5
            * Adjust the OpenApiCustomizers if you have any problem with generating the right docs
            ---
            #### What has changed
              Micrometer tracing support is now autoconfigured by default.
              This includes support for Brave, OpenTelemetry, Zipkin and Wavefront.

              Now we can unify the tracing configuration

            #### What has changed
              [Read the SB 3.0 release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes)
            ---
            #### Other libraries upgrades
              Exposed .38.2 -> .53
            * Lots of deprecated methods
            * Removed [PassingThreadLocalsCoroutineElement](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1722)
            * Use `newSuspendedTransaction` instead of `@Transactional` for coroutines
            * It became more type-safe and we had to change ColumnType classes
            * replace became upsert. Don't use replace anymore
            * [Other breaking changes](http://jetbrains.github.io/Exposed/breaking-changes.html)
            ---
            #### Other libraries upgrades
              gRPC 1.64 -> 1.66
            * [1.64 wasn't compatible with Netty 4.1.111.Final](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11284#issuecomment-2197633242)
            ---
            ### Benefits
            * Less vulnerabilities
            * Spring Boot 3.0 applications can now be converted into GraalVM native images
            * Better performance

            ### Pitfalls
            * Lots of deprecated methods that wasn't fixed in the upgrade
            * New bugs
            * Broke some local setups
            ---
            ### Advices for future upgrades
            * Don’t upgrade the spring doc if not needed (the quality of this library is really bad)
            * Don’t upgrade the exposed if not needed
            (there are lots of changes between minor versions because it wasn’t released yet to a stable 1.X.X version)
            * Don’t upgrade anything if not needed for Spring Boot migration
            ---
            ### Advices for future upgrades
            * Firstly migrate the stock and oauth2 libraries
            * Be aware of shaded dependencies
            (pulsar dep. has to be used with -original suffix because it doesn’t shade protobuf)
            * Use `gradle --scan` to analyze libraries versions
            * Lock a library version in gradle if needed using dependency resolution -> all -> useVersion()
            ---
            ### Advices for future upgrades
            * Read carefully the official migration guides
            * Use [rewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org) which has a [plugin for gradle](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-gradle-plugin)
            ```kotlin
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.framework.UpgradeSpringFramework_6_0")
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.SpringBoot3BestPractices")
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_0")
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_1")
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_2")
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_3")
              activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxMigrationToJakarta")
            ```
            ---
            ### What might be wrong here?
            ```kotlin
            @Test
            fun `405 wrong method client error`() {
                webTestClient
                    .get().uri("/api/v1/test")
                    .exchange()
                    .expectStatus().isEqualTo(405)
                    .expectProblem {
                        hasStatus(Status.METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED)
                        hasDetail("405 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED \"Request method 'GET' not supported\"")
                        hasTitle("Method Not Allowed")
                        hasType(URI.create("about:blank"))
                    }
            }
            ```
            ---
            ### Advices for future upgrades
            * Don't use hardcoded strings in tests that may depends on the spring boot version
            ```diff
            - "Request method 'GET' not supported"
            + "Request method 'GET' is not supported."
            ```
            ---
